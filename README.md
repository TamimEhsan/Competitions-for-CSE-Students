# Competitions-for-CSE-Students

Some of the competitions that a CSE Student of Bangladesh can participate during his undergrad life. Some of them allow students below undergrad or above it too.

The information are incomplete, can be wrong and in no way are official from the organizers. Some of the competitions might not occur in the future too. 

This is just a list created from what I recall about past competitions. 

If there are any mistakes that needs to be corrected create a pull request or raise a issue. I'll fix that.
